# Dart Introduction Course

Welcome to the **Dart Introduction Course** repository by Bayt-al-Hikmah! This collection of lecture notes is designed for beginners and intermediate learners aiming to master Dart programming fundamentals. Whether you're new to coding or refreshing your skills, these notes provide structured, step-by-step guidance through core concepts.

Bayt-al-Hikmah (House of Wisdom) is dedicated to preserving and disseminating knowledge, inspired by the historic intellectual center of the Islamic Golden Age. These lectures emphasize clear explanations, practical examples, and hands-on exercises to build a strong foundation in the Dart language.

## Prerequisites

- Basic familiarity with computers and file management.
    
- No prior programming experience required (though helpful).
    
- Dart SDK and an IDE like Visual Studio Code with the Dart extension.
    

### Setup Instructions

1. Install the Dart SDK:
    
    - Download from dart.dev.
        
    - Follow the instructions for your OS (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
        
2. Install an editor/IDE: Visual Studio Code with the Dart extension is recommended for beginners.
    
3. Test your setup: Run a "Hello, World!" program (example in Lecture 1) using:
    
    ```bash
    dart run hello_world.dart
    ```
    

## Course Overview

This 5-lecture series covers essential Dart topics progressively. Each lecture includes:

- Theoretical explanations.
    
- Code examples and snippets.
    
- Exercises for practice.
    
- References for further reading.
